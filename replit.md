# MLB Daily Matchup Analytics

## Overview

This repository contains a streamlined MLB analytics application built with Python and Streamlit. The application automatically pulls today's MLB games and provides AI-powered predictions and probability analysis for all players, including pitcher strikeouts. The focus is on daily matchup analysis with clean, organized presentation of MLB team data only.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Focus: Daily MLB games with automatic data loading, no manual player input required.
Display: Clean interface showing predictions and probabilities for today's matchups only.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition**: `MLBDataFetcher` retrieves data from MLB Stats API
2. **Caching**: API responses cached for 5 minutes to reduce load
3. **Processing**: `AnalyticsEngine` performs statistical calculations
4. **Prediction**: `MLPredictor` generates performance forecasts
5. **Visualization**: `Visualizer` creates interactive charts
6. **Presentation**: Streamlit renders the web interface

## External Dependencies

### MLB Stats API
- **Base URL**: `https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1`
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented through caching
- **Authentication**: No API key required (public endpoints)
- **Data Types**: Teams, players, statistics, game data

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute cache timeout for API responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with sample data
- **Memory Management**: Efficient pandas operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components initialized only when needed

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **Streamlit Server**: Built-in development server
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic code reloading during development
- **Environment**: Python 3.7+ with pip dependencies

### Production Considerations
- **Containerization**: Docker-ready architecture
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling

- **Security**: Input validation and API rate limiting

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and configuration
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle features without code changes
- **Logging**: Configurable logging levels
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjustable cache timeouts and model parameters

The application is designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible, with clear separation between data fetching, analytics processing, machine learning, and visualization components.
